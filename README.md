# Fine-Tune BERT for Text Classification

This repository contains a Python notebook that demonstrates the process of fine-tuning BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) for text classification tasks. BERT is a powerful pre-trained language model developed by Google that has achieved state-of-the-art results in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks.

## Notebook Contents

The notebook provides a step-by-step guide on how to fine-tune BERT for text classification. Here is a brief overview of the main sections:

1. Installation and Setup:
   - Installing TensorFlow and TensorFlow Model Garden
   - Cloning the TensorFlow models repository
   
2. Dataset Preparation:
   - Downloading and importing the Quora Insincere Questions Dataset
   - Exploring the dataset
   
3. Creating tf.data.Datasets for Training and Evaluation:
   - Splitting the dataset into training and validation sets
   - Creating tf.data.Datasets for the training and validation data
   
4. Task 5: Downloading a Pre-trained BERT Model from TensorFlow Hub:
   - Installing the necessary dependencies
   - Downloading the BERT model from TensorFlow Hub
   
5. Fine-Tuning BERT for Text Classification:
   - Preprocessing the text data for BERT input features
   - Defining the label categories and maximum sequence length
   - Building the BERT model using the pre-trained BERT layer and tokenizer
   - Training and evaluating the model
   
## Usage

To use this notebook, follow these steps:

1. Install TensorFlow and TensorFlow Model Garden by running the appropriate pip commands.
2. Clone the TensorFlow models repository to access the required files and utilities.
3. Download the Quora Insincere Questions Dataset and update the file path accordingly.
4. Run each cell in the notebook sequentially to execute the code and observe the results.
5. Modify the code as needed to adapt it to your own text classification task.
